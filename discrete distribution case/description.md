Complete network of users is confidential, hence we desire to obtain a representative sample of complete network.

Use of Deezers : online friendship network data.
Nodes = 47,538 Edges = 222,887 . A complete network.

2 methods used to obtain representative sample from it
1. Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW)
2. proposed sampling algorithm embedded oin the MHRW

Vi : i from 1 to N.
N = 47,538

Kv : degree of vertex v , v belongs to Vi.


We want to make inferences about Node degree of this network. : 
1. Median (M)
2. std. deviation 
3. p1 = 1/N(Sum Kv) : Kv < 7 
4. p2 = 1/N(Sum Kv) : Kv < 15 
5. p3 = 1/N(Sum Kv) : Kv < 25
